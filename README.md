# MedChat-Fine-tuning-Llama-with-LoRA-and-Unsloth-on-the-MedQuAD-Dataset-for-a-Medical-Chatbot
Steps for Fine-tuning:
Prepare the MedQuAD Dataset:

The MedQuAD dataset is a high-quality collection of medical question-answer pairs that will serve as the training data.

Preprocess the dataset to extract the relevant questions and answers for training.

Use LoRA for Efficient Fine-tuning:

LoRA is a technique that allows you to fine-tune large models in a memory-efficient way by adding low-rank updates to the model's weight matrices, instead of fully retraining the model. This approach reduces the computational overhead significantly.

Optimize Training with Unsloth:

Unsloth is a tool designed to optimize the training pipeline, particularly when dealing with large-scale models and datasets. It helps in speeding up the fine-tuning process while maintaining model performance.

Load the Llama model from Hugging Face.

Apply LoRA to the model for efficient parameter updates during training.

Fine-tune the model on the MedQuAD dataset using the question-answer pairs.

Deploy the Model as a Chatbot:

Once fine-tuning is complete, deploy the model as a chatbot that can answer medical questions based on the knowledge it has gained from the MedQuAD dataset.
